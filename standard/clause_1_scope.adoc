== Scope
This document is OGC Standard that describes an extended internal structure for a image file that requires more than 4GBytes. The general structure is similar to the TIFF specification version 6 but two essential data structures called Image File Header and Image File Directory are replaced by Big File Header and Big Image File Directory to support the necessary longer integer numbers that act as internal offsets of the file. It also adds 3 new extra data types: LONG8 (uint64) SLONG8 (int64) or IFD8 (uint64).
