== Media Types for any data encoding(s)
A section describing the MIME-types to be used is mandatory for any Standard involving data encodings. If no suitable MIME type exists in http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html then this section may be used to define a new MIME type for registration with IANA.

Amongst the suggested file extensions are 'tif', 'tf8' and 'btf' (see discussion in the LibTiff mailing list).
