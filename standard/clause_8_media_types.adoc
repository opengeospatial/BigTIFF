== Media Types for any data encoding(s)
IANA defines the image/tiff media type for TIFF (https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/image/tiff). Since the software is able to programaticaly differenciate between a TIFF and a BigTIFF, we suggest the use of the same media time for the BigTIFF.

We also suggest the use of the same file extension ('tif' or 'tiff') despite other suggestions such as 'tf8' and 'btf' (as some time ago discussed in the LibTiff mailing list).
