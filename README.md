# BigTIFF community standard candidate

This GitHub repository contains the content for an OGC Community Standard candidate for BigTIFF (OGC 21-061)

BigTIFF was originated outside the OGC and mainly maintained at https://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/bigtiff.html and the intention is that it becomes an OGC standard with the support of the community or an OGC community standard.  This repository reproduces the current status of the COG practices collected mainly from https://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff/bigtiff.html and translates it into formal requirements and an OGC standards template.

This repository was originated from the work in Testbed 17 and the original documents are in https://gitlab.ogc.org/ogc/T17-D046-COG-Specification-ER/-/tree/master/standardDrafts/BigTIFF. The intention is to keep them aligned (manually) until the end of Testbed 17 when the work will exclusively continue in the GeoTIFF.SWG.

The repo is organized as follows:

* index.adoc - nothing in this document
* standard - the main Standard document content
  - organized in multiple sections and directories
  - this is the only part needed to create a Standard
